/*
PROBLEM: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. 
Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand. Write an the insertion_sort algorithm using the following instructions:

INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
2.  Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1.
